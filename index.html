        <p>Motocross bikes are designed to be incredibly lightweight, with most bikes weighing around 220 to 250 pounds. This low weight, combined with powerful engines, allows riders to make quick, agile maneuvers on rough and uneven terrain. The design of these bikes focuses on durability and strength, making them capable of withstanding harsh landings, jumps, and extreme conditions that are common in motocross racing.</p>
