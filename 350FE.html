            The FE 350 is known for its versatility in all types of terrain. With a lightweight chassis and enhanced all-round performance, it possesses 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, while keeping the light and agile feel of a 250. Already a preferred choice for those wanting a perfect balance of weight and power, the motorcycle combines premium WP suspension, innovative electronics and comfortable ergonomics, along with a host of other innovative refinements that make the FE 350 second to none when the going gets tough.
